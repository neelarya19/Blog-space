  Blog space is a blogging website for those who are eager to express
themselves and share their experiences with others. In this website any
user can create his profile, tell others about himself only what he wants,
choose his interests corresponding to which he wants to see the contents
and meet the new people. By using that profile, the user can also make
posts. Our main goal via this website is to create space for likeminded
people to hangout and build their community stronger Backend.
